## Building

First build this package, then build its jars by running:

```{r eval=FALSE}
sparklyr::compile_package_jars()
```

then build the R package as usual.

## Getting Started

Connect and test this package as follows:

```{r}
library(r_project)
library(sparklyr)
sc <- spark_connect(master = "local")

r_project_hello(sc)
```

```{r}
spark_disconnect_all()
```
