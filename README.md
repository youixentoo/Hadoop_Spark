# Hadoop_Spark

Welcome to my R script using Spark. I have no experience with programming in R. Luckily I could use my knowledge of Python and Java to get something working.<br>
<br>
There are folders in the R folder, the script that processes the data (data_processing.R), is in the "Main_Script" folder. It can be run directly, but it does need one script from the "Learning" folder.<br>
The "Learning" folder has scripts I used to learn Spark. To be able to use them, run connection.R first, that sets some global environment variables needed to run the functions in the other scripts.

## System
This is all written and tested on Windows. Can't guarantee that it works on Linux.

## Installation
I followed this guide for installing Spark:
