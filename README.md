# Hadoop_Spark

Welcome to my R script using Spark. I have no experience with programming in R. Luckily I could use my knowledge of Python and Java to get something working.

## System
This is all written and tested on Windows. Can't guarantee that it works on Linux.

## Installation
I followed this guide for installing Spark:
